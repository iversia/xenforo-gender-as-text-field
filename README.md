XenForo Gender as a Text Field
===================

Out of the box, XenForo defines gender as being either "male, female, or unspecified." This add-on removes the radio buttons and replaces them with a plain text field that your users may then enter anything into. 

Features
------------
* **Fucks the gender binary**
* Breaks many, if not all, gender-related add-ons
* Changes the radio buttons for gender (male, female, unspecified) to a text field
* Removes gender from the registration form (one less registration hurdle)

### Why would you want to do this? ###
1. [Disalienation](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2010/11/26/disalienation/).
1. You really don't care about gender demographics.
1. You welcome people of all gender presentations.
1. You don't mind people getting "creative" with their gender presentation.

### Why wouldn't you want to do this? ###
1. It will absolutely break many, if not all, gender-related XenForo add-ons.
1. Marketers will lose the ability to target your users based upon their gender.
1. You will not be able to search or group users by gender (eg. have male or female only boards).
1. Gender as a Text Field has been deemed the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse. Usability Chaos.
